echo "760 edpi: Use bottom of palm to glide along mousepad slowly. Don't only use wrist. Move mouse with arm, but use wrist to adjust. If you only use wrist, you'll think it's too high."
echo "Use ring finger nail to dig into the mousepad and slow down mouse movement, so it doesn't feel as high."
echo "With pinky finger, press directly into the curved plastic in order to have good aim."
echo "Pivot the mouse about the bottom of palm.  Use minimal arm movement."
